        <p class="intro">
          I am a pupil attending Orchard Mead Academy with great career aspirations for the future. 
          I study Computer Science, Design and Technology, and Business. 
          At an early age I always had a great passion for computers and how software functions behind the scenes, making this one of my most anticipated picks.
          Consequently, I have decided to pick Design and Technology alongside Computer Science because computers are an essential tool in making products through CAM and CAD and I feel like they make a perfect combination for crucial and high paying jobs in modern society. 
          Finally, I have chosen Business so that I know all the implications of opening a firm and how to do it if I would like to open my own in the future.

          <p class="qualities">
            If there were three words to describe me, they would be; trustworthy, hardworking, and compassionate. 
            My friends often say that I am honest and very caring for others. 
            Furthermore, I have been praised for my responsibility by others countless times, whether it is for doing my work in and outside of class or dealing with people’s issues, concerns or questions. 
            In my lessons, I am very enthusiastic and engaged when learning something that interests me, acting as a good active listener as well as being very observant and aware of my surroundings. 
            Usually when I struggle with something, I like trying to find a solution for it on my own first and then asking a teacher as a last resort and I must credit my curious and determined mindset for that.

        <p class="hobbiestlt">Hobbies:</p>
        <p class="hobbies">
          In my spare time, I undertake many hobbies some of which are; playing football and/or basketball on weekends, Thai boxing at Tigerz Gym (Though I haven’t been there in a while), practice technical drawing skills like isometric and 2 point perspective and finally I like to code in various programming languages like python, SQL, HTML, CSS, JavaScript a little bit and I am currently learning C#. 
          The reason I decided to take up hobbies like football and boxing is because I want to stay in shape while being relaxed and enjoying myself because I believe that health is one of the most important things someone has. 
          I also lift weights from time to time to also develop my muscles and stamina so I can care more for myself and my health. 
          Occasionally, I undertake hobbies like technical drawing and learning programming languages because not only is it interesting but also it helps me stay ahead of the Design Technology and Computer Science lessons which are my probably favorite subjects. 
          Furthermore, this is an effective way to ensure that I stay productive without wasting too much time doing useless things like playing games or going on social media.

        <p class="skilltlt">Skills/Strengths:</p>
        <p class="skill">
          During my time at secondary school, I received many praises and awards for exemplary attendance and good behaviour .
           Some of the awards I received were Bronze and Silver Certificates for behaviour, 100% attendance pins, won £10 vouchers for attendance twice in a row, 
           a trip to Drayton Manor for behaviour and another one to Ninja Warrior and Shoutouts to parents. I would say my strengths lie in good communication, 
           creativity when coming up with a solution, digital skills when coding or understanding computers and 
           linguistical skills because I speak French fluently and I am learning Arabic.

      <div class="container_6" id="workxp">
        <p class="worktlt">Work Experience:</p>
        <p class="work">
          I have some work experience. 
          I have work experience from paid car washing jobs a few times for my father and brother, paid lawn mowing and gardening and I have done some voluntary chores around the house. 
          Overall, these jobs have taught me honesty when dealing with clients, organizing my time to fit these jobs into my schedule, patience when doing manual labour, resilience when I was tired and in difficulty and finally communication and negotiation when coming to a price. 
          I strongly believe these skills will help shape me when moving forward with my education because I need to be honest when dealing with people and I need to be organized especially for college where there is a lot of content and some spare time. 
          Even beyond education I think honesty, resilience/patience and organization are a valuable set of traits in a person in everyday life and are transferable to any situation or context you could be put in.

          <p class="futuretlt">My Goals/Future:</p>
          <p class="future">
            My goal for the future is to work in a high demand and very technical job that I’m pleased with. I aspire to go into robotics or engineering (perhaps software engineer) or maybe architecture. 
            However, I believe, and I hope that my experience at college will bring light and help me determine my course and pathway for the future.
