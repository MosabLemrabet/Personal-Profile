        1. ChatGPT Article:
      </h1>

          This is the first website I have Published using Github. 
          It was meant to be an article about ChatGPT and AI a few months after it came out.
          It was a quite simple and short code and I used ChatGPT to find the advantages and disadvantages and most of the text.
          It also has a link to the OpenAI website at the bottom.
          <br>
          <br>
          This website features a moving image at the back of binary numbers, with little sections as seen in the picture. 
          I have also made it in a black and green theme to reflect the components of a computer like motherboard which are green.
          Overall, I think that this website was pretty easy to make except for the horizontal scroll boxes which took me a moment to figure out.

        2. Online Recipes:
      </h1>
      <div class="imgtxtcon2">
        <img src="website2.png" class="websiteimg2">
        <p class="des2">
          This is the second example of one of my published works.
          Again I have Published it using Github and it was meant to be an online recipe website for recipes of different cultures.
          Though I have not finished this one, I believe it was a crucial step in helping me develop and put to the test my HTML skills.
          Compared to the previous website I published, This one was a major step forward because I got to experiment with "DIV" tags.
          Moreover, I started developping a knowledge of themes and how colours can blend together.
          <br>
          <br>
          This website features two sections (main dishes and desserts) which were accessible via links at the top. 
          I also started using shadows when hovering over a link and different fonts from google fonts.
          The themes for this website were green and orange because the recipes in there are oriental so I think these colours really demonstrates that.
